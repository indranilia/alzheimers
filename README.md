# alzheimers
This project attempts to explore the applications of different models in classifying and predicting Alzheimer's.

## Datasets
The first dataset contains cross-sectional MRI data of young, middle-aged, nondemented and demented older adults. A total of 416 subjects ages 18 to 96 underwent single-session MRI-scans. 100 of the subjects have a clinically diagnozed Alzheimer's. 

The second dataset contains longitudinal data of 150 adults ages 60 to 96 with and without diagnosed Alzheimer's. Each subject was scanned at least twice with 1 year between the scans. 64 of the subjects had been diagnozed with Alzheimer's at the time of their first visits. 

## Project aims
The main goals of this project is to explore the possible applications of data science in neuroscience, specifically within the context of Alzheimer's. Supplemented by additional research in cognitive neuroscience, I intend to critically evaluate the applications of data science models and neuroscientific methods in diagnozing and classifying pathologies. 

## Project ideas
For the first dataset, the current idea is to explore different types of classifier models for MRI scans of demented and non-demented patients. 

For the second dataset, the current idea is to build a model that predicts early signs of Alzheimer's.
